Do you trust my code? (Don't worry, it's not a virus. It's just *incredibly* useless.)

## Compiling 

> You need the dotnet framework installed

### Set compiler environment variable
1. Go to `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\` then the latest release.
2. Copy the path e.g. `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319`.
3. Search "env" and open `Edit the system environment variables`.
4. Click `Environment Variables...`.
5. Under `User variables for [User]`, select `Path`, then `Edit`.
7. Click `New` and paste the path.
8. Click `OK` to all prompts.

> Test by typing `csc` in a new terminal

### To compile
1. Go to project and run compile.bat
2. This creates Multi.exe
